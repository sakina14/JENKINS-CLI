Q:How to use jenkins cli and how can we run/build our jenkins job using jenkins cli?

Before starting jenkins cli  launch an instance in EC2 with port:8080
Then connect with putty
In that server we should install java,apache tomcat and jenkins and create a new folder to run jenkins job
Take the server ipaddress and paste in browser:https//ipaddress:8080/jenkins
login to jenkins with username and password

Now coming to jenkins cli:
go to jenkins:click on manage jenkins ->click on jenkins cli
There you can see jenkins-cli.jar copy that link
And paste in local server :wget jenkins-cli.jar
Then start the jenkins job to build in local server
[root....jenkins]#https:java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://192-168.16:8080/jenkins -http build job(remove job and give your job name)
 It throws an error 
ofcourse it will fail becoz our jenkins required the permissions so right we are logged with credentials

If you want to execute your job without credentials:
Then go to jenkins:manage jenkins->security->authorization select Any one can do anything option ->save
Come back to our local server
[root..jenkins]#java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://192-168.16:8080/jenkins -http build job(remove job and give your job name)
now this time sucessfull but doesn't show the result
To see the o/p of your build on terminal itself then add -f 
[root..jenkins]java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://192-168.16:8080/jenkins -http build job(remove job and give your job name) -f
started BUild #1
compeleted Build#1:sucess
same build o/p you can see in jenkins as well

to see more verbose o/p(logs) you can use -v -f
[root...jenkins]#java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://192-168.16:8080/jenkins -http build job(remove job and give your job name) -v -f
you can see the console o/p on terminal
so there are many commands not only build you do many things

now we will see with credentials:
Go to jenkins:manage jenkins->security->authorization logged-in users can do anything and enable anomynous read acess->save
come back to our local server 
[root .... jenkins>]#java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://192-168.16:8080/jenkins -http build job(remove job and give your job name)
error:anomynous /build permission

Go to jenkins click on admin->configure
add token:generate the token and copy that token 

in local server
[root ... jenkins]#vi .clitoken
admin:paste token password
:wq!
[root ... jenkins]#pwd
copy the path
[root ... jenkins]# java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://192-168.16:8080/jenkins/ -http -auth @/opt/jenkins/.clitoken who-am-i
